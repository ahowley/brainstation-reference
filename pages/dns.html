      <p class="main__description">
        DNS (the Domain Name System) allows us to host a website at a specific domain name, instead of needing to use an
        IP address directly. It lets us link together an arbitrary domain, with a registered top-level domain, to the IP
        address of our website.
      </p>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          Top-level domains include the classics like ".com", ".net", and ".org", and they are registerable by anyone
          (technically).
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          From there, the chain of "responsibility" flows first by any "dots" that are chained together, then to the
          app's routing itself. For example - "example.project.com/test" would first find ".com", which would point to
          "project", which would point to "example", which would point to "test".
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          DNS servers, or computers somewhere out there on the web that control DNS routing and registration,
          <strong>cache</strong> lookup values to accelerate response times.
        </li>
        <li class="note">We can set a <strong>TTL, or Time-to-Live,</strong>, to extend our DNS cache time.</li>
        <li class="note">
          DNS is regulated by a non-profit organization called
          <strong>ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)</strong>, and the
          <strong>IANA</strong> oversees IP allocation.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          You can buy (or, more aptly, lease) a domain name from a registrar like NameSilo, namecheap, AWS Route 53,
          etc.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Once you have a domain, you can use a DNS record to point that domain to the IP address of the server hosting
          your website.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Once you have a dedicated location hosting your site, the hosting service will typically show you what to
          enter to configure your DNS record.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          For debugging a DNS record, <a href="https://www.whatsmydns.net/">whatsmydns.com</a>, or the domain
          propagation tool, is useful for confirming info about your domain.
