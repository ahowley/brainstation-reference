      <h1 class="main__heading">React</h1>
      <p class="main__description">
        React is a framework developed by Meta that's designed around creating complex web applications with highly
        dynamic content built around reusable UI components. See more on
        <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank">React's website here</a>.
      </p>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Overview</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          React is designed around components, which can be reused throughout a web application. At the time of writing,
          it's arguably the most popular front-end application on the web.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Next.js was built on React, and is a newer framework that takes React's features to the next level.
        </li>
        <li class="note">React is modular, and provides ways to unit test our UI more easily.</li>
        <li class="note">
          It's also flexible and fast, and conveniently, React can render on the server-side as well as the client-side.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Good tooling is available - like the <code>create-react-app</code> scaffolding, the React devtools chrome
          extension, and detailed error messages when something goes wrong.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Creating and Running a React App</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/" target="_blank">create-react-app</a> is a scaffolding tool available
          via npm to make setting up new React projects quickly and easily.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target="_blank">Vite</a> is another way to create an environment, allowing for
          quick-start servers, live module replacement, and has gained popularity in recent years. This is an
          alternative to <code>create-react-app</code>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Our React project will include a few folders and files essentially always: one is
          <strong>node_modules</strong>, one is <strong>public</strong> (which contains public front-end assets like a
          favicon), and one is <strong>src</strong>, which contains our front-end files.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Other files include <strong>package.json</strong>, which defines which packages are necessary for your app to
          run, <strong>package-lock.json</strong>, which works with package.json to ensure all developers working on the
          app are using the same versions of packages, and a readme.
        </li>
        <li class="note">To run an npm app, we can run <code>npm start</code> in the console.</li>
        <li class="note">
          App.js is a component that represents what we want to go into our React root. That root is defined inside
          index.js (by default according to create-react-app).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Components</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          Components are the building blocks of any page in React - the first step of building a React application is
          chunking out bigger components into their smaller portions.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Component definitions are created in classes or functions, and have a capitalized first letter.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          We instantiate a React "root" by defining where the application should reference and insert itself:
          <pre><code>const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Our components will often live in their own module, which will also have a capitalized file name. This will be
          the default export of the app.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Traditionally, React components used to only be allowed to store state when using class-based components. More
          recently, in 2019, a more functional approach has been supported by way of <strong>React Hooks</strong>, which
          let us access class-like state inside functional components. Since functional syntax allows us to write less
          code to accomplish the same task, this is generally the preferred method.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          A React component must return only one parent element or wrapper. This can be a <code>div</code>, a
          <code>ul</code>, or any other html element, or it can be an empty wrapper called a
          <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment" target="_blank">Fragment</a>. Elements in a fragment will
          behave as if they have no parent when added to the DOM.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">JSX</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          <a href="https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx" target="_blank">JSX</a> is a
          <strong>JavaScript Syntax Extension</strong> that allows us to write code in a way we wouldn't be allowed to
          with vanilla JavaScript. It looks like a templating language but has the full power of JavaScript available
          directly in the .js file.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          We use JSX to write html-like syntax directly inside our JavaScript, which is then rendered/compiled as
          JavaScript by React and node.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          To create a very simple component, our code inside a file like "MyComponent.js" might look something like
          this:
          <pre><code>function MyComponent() {
  return {
    &#60;div className="my-class">
      &#60;h1>Hello, World!&#60;/h1>
    &#60;/div>
  }
}</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          We can add HTML attributes directly to elements in JSX, but we have to adjust any that conflict with reserved
          JavaScript keyworrds. For example, <code>for</code> becomes <code>htmlFor</code>, and
          <code>class</code> becomes <code>className</code>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          We can mimic HTML attributes as
          <a href="https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component" target="_blank"><strong>props</strong></a> by
          including the argument in our component inside curly braces (destructured). For example:
          <pre><code>function MyComponent({ myProp }) {
    &#60;div className="my-class">
      &#60;h1>{ myProp }&#60;/h1>
    &#60;/div>
}</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          To subsequently render a component inside another component, we can first import the component we need, then
          use a self-closing html-like syntax to render an instance of that component.
          <pre><code>import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";
  
function MyOtherComponent() {
  return &#60;div class="my-other-class">
    &#60;MyComponent myProp="Hello, World!" />
  &#60;/div>
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Virtual DOM</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          React's <strong>Virtual DOM</strong> holds a representation of the DOM in memory at all times for us to
          modify, which allows us to only update the actual DOM once per modification.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          The Virtual DOM is a tree of <code>ReactElement</code>s that hold the state of the DOM and allow for many
          changes to be made quickly without needing to modify the DOM each time a change is made.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          The real DOM on the front-end of our app isn't updated except by <code>root.render()</code> in index.js.
        </li>
      </ul>
