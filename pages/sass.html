      <h2 class="main__subheading">Overview</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          Sass is a <strong>CSS Preprocessor</strong> built for front-end styling that is compiled into regular CSS for
          the browser to understand the code.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Sass is a styling framework that keeps development close to CSS, as opposed to attempting to offer
          out-of-the-box styling options or pre-built classes.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Sass attempts to improve reusability, keep the code cleaner and better organized, and allows a simpler
          workflow for splitting up files/partials.
        </li>
        <li class="note">Sass supports nesting, and allows the use of mixins.</li>
        <li class="note">Common file extentions for Sass include .scss and .sass.</li>
        <li class="note">Anything you can write in CSS, you can write in Sass.</li>
        <li class="note">
          BEM, and Sass, do not need to mimic HTML. A parent-child relationship as understood by the browser is not
          necessarily the same as a parent-child or block-element relationship in the overarching site design.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Compiling</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          There are many ways to compile scss, and one simple way is the
          <strong>Live Sass Compiler</strong> by Glenn Marks in VSCode.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          After clicking <strong>Watch Sass</strong> with the extension installed, a style.scss file will be compiled
          into style.css.map and style.css file in the same directory.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          If compilation fails, it won't save the results of compilation into your css file. Keep an eye on the terminal
          when a change you've made doesn't seem to work.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          the .css.map file helps the browser know where the css file is coming from - it allows dev tools to navigate
          your scss code when debugging.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          In your settings.json in your .vscode folder, you can define various settings for the Live Compiler.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="main__code-block">
        <pre><code>"liveSassCompile.settings.formats": [
  {
    "format": "expanded",
    "extensionName": ".css",
    "savePath": null
  },
  {
    "format": "compressed",
    "extensionName": ".min.css",
    "savePath": "/dist/css"
  },
  {
    "format": "compressed",
    "extensionName": ".min.css",
    "savePath": "~/../css/"
  }
]</code></pre>
      </div>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Variables</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          Sass supports <strong>variables</strong> using a simple syntax: <code>$variable: value</code> assigns a value,
          and <code>$variable</code> references that value.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Sass variables have <strong>scope</strong>, meaning that variable names can be redefined per scss file, unlike
          default css.
        </li>
        <li class="note">Convention tells us to define $variables at the top of a file.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Mixins</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">Help DRY up code by using <strong>arguments</strong> in place of the normal CSS cascade.</li>
        <li class="note">
          You can import a mixin into any block of CSS that you'd like, leveraging reusable code without expanding
          complexity in terms of structure.
        </li>
        <li class="note">Convention tells us to define @mixins at the top of the file, below variables.</li>
        <li class="note">
          Mixins are defined with a function-like syntax: <code>@mixin mixin-name($param1, $param2)</code>
        </li>
        <li class="note">Mixins are referenced using <code>@import mixin-name(value1, value2)</code></li>
        <li class="note">Mixins can be imported into other mixins.</li>
        <li class="note">
          Mixins do support some business logic processing as well, that we didn't cover in our first lecture on Sass.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          An alternative way to use mixins is to use <code>@extend .css-selector</code>, which will import all the css
          properties from the provided css selector.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          In general, if you have a choice between @import and @extend, it is probably best to lean toward @import to
          stick with the overarching design goal of having a
          <strong>"single source of truth"</strong>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          We can use <code>@content</code> to define a wrapper mixin, allowing us to use a mixin as a wrapper. For
          example, the following mixins could be used to create a media query surrounding a css block:
        </li>
        <pre><code>@mixin tablet {
  @media (min-width: 426px) and (max-width: 767px) {
    @content;
  }
}

@include tablet {
  .hidden-tablet {
    display: none;
  }
}</code></pre>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Nesting</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          You can nest element selectors in Sass, which is equivalent to using a descendant selector in CSS.
          <code>div { margin: 0; } div a { color: blue; }</code> becomes
          <code>div { margin: 0; a { color: blue; } }</code>
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          We can look for specific elements in a BEM-like way using <strong>ampersand</strong>. The ampersand
          <strong>only looks at the name of the selector it's referencing</strong>, meaning it doesn't care about how
          deeply nested an element might be.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          For example: to target an unordered list with class "nav__list", we could do that like this:
          <code>.nav { &__list {} }</code>, but we could also target a list item inside that list in the same block:
          <code>.nav { &__list {} &__list-item {} }</code>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          You can use ampersand to exploit nesting to simplify pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.
          <code>.button { &:hover {} }</code> would compile to <code>.button {} .button:hover {}</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Imports, Code Structure, Conventions</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          For the sake of separation of concerns, you can import other scss files with
          <code>@use './styles.scss'</code> at the top of an scss file.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          To prevent scss files from compiling, we can use the underscore convention to tell an scss file that it should
          be "private", or that it is only for use via import in other scss files.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Files that are prefixed with an underscore and only used by other scss files are called
          <strong>partials</strong>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          When importing with @use or rerencing an imported file, you
          <strong>don't have to include underscores from this convention</strong>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Because variables are private, after important, we need to use the imported file name when referencing
          variables and mixins from imported scss. If <code>$variable</code> is defined in _global.scss, to reference
          this variable in local.scss that's importing _global, we need to use <code>global.$variable</code>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          We can get around the above by using a wildcard in the import to expose all imported variables to the current
          scope. Using the previous example, we would import _global.scss using
          <code>@use global.scss as *;</code>, after which we could just use <code>$variable</code> anywhere in
          local.scss, without the "global." prefix.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Convention tells us to have a "_globals.scss" for things we want to apply to literally every single page
          without exception.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          We can then import partials into a single styles.scss file that is applied to all pages, and BEM will ensure
          we don't face problems with scope. This improves separation of concerns by ensuring designers don't need to
          edit HTML to apply their styles.
        </li>
