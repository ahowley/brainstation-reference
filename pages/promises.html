        A <code>Promise</code> in Javascript is an object that represents the outcome of some asynchronous operation. It
        provides a simple way to create asynchronous operations that can be called from within otherwise synchronous
        code. Check out

      <h2 class="main__subheading">Intro to Asynchronous Execution</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          Asynchronous execution is the name for code that can run "in the background" while the rest of your program
          continues running. This is also known as <strong>non-blocking</strong> code.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          This is in contrast to synchronous execution, which is usually <strong>blocking</strong> - meaning that
          whatever runs will prevent the stuff after it from running until it's done.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Most JS is <strong>synchronous</strong> by default - Promises provide us a way to turn slow operations, like
          getting data from elsewhere on the web, into non-blocking, <strong>asynchronous</strong> execution.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Promise Overview</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          A <strong>Promise</strong> is an "agreement" to do something in the future, and holds information about what
          it "promises" to do.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          The Promise object will contain information about what we requested it to do - was it successful? Was it
          rejected? Etc.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> are "syntactical sugar" that makes promises read a little nicer in
          code, but under the hood they just create and respond to promises.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Promises have 3 states - <strong>pending</strong>, <strong>fulfilled</strong>, and <strong>rejected</strong>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          When creating a custom Promise, we will have two states to define - a <code>resolve</code> and
          <code>reject</code> parameter. We don't need this when we use <code>async/await</code>, because we use
          standard <code>try {} catch {}</code> blocks instead.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          When performing an asynchronous operation with <code>async/await</code>, we typically wrap our operation in a
          <code>try/catch</code> block so we can handle any errors that may happen. If we're only doing one thing
          asynchronously, it's not strictly necessary, but it still rarely hurts to include.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Creating a New Promise</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          We can create a new Promise using the built-in Promise object with the <code>new</code> keyword. A promise
          takes one parameter - a callback function - and that function parameter should itself accept two arguments -
          <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          In our callback, we tell the promise what Asynchronous operation to perform, then can choose to either
          <code>resolve()</code> or <code>reject()</code> that operation. In these function calls, we are providing
          arguments for <code>.then()</code> and <code>.catch()</code>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          For example, if our callback gets the text content of an article, we could call
          <code>resolve(articleText);</code> when we successfully get the article text, and
          <code>reject(error)</code> if we fail to receive the article text.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          From our promise, we can then use <code>.then(onFulfillment, onRejection)</code> with onFulfillment
          representing a function containing what to do if the operation succeeds, and onRejection representing a
          function containing what to do if it fails.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          We can also, after the .then(), use <code>.catch(onRejection)</code> to handle any errors from the rejected
          state in another onRejection function.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          When used with await, a promise will "return" whatever we pass to <code>resolve()</code>, and will pass
          anything we give to <code>reject()</code> to a catch block's parameter.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          An async function will automatically mimic a function that returns a promise without requiring explicit
          callback chaining. So an async function will automatically reject if there is an uncaught exception in the
          function body, passing that exception to a catch block where it's resolved, and its return value is similar to
          what is normally passed inside of <code>resolve()</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Promise Chaining</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          To get the results of multiple promises without using <code>await</code> or <code>.then()</code>, we can use
          one of several built-in <code>Promise</code> methods that "collect" the results of these promises.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          <code>Promise.all(promisesIterable)</code> returns a single promise, and will resolve when all the promises
          passed as arguments succeed, or reject when any of the promises contained inside reject. It resolves with an
          array of resulting objects from each Promise, and rejects with the first reason for a rejection.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          <code>Promise.allSettled(promisesIterable)</code> is the same as Promise.all, but resolves when all promises
          in the iterable <strong>settle</strong>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          <code>Promise.any(promisesIterable)</code> is like Promise.all, but resolves when <strong>any</strong> of the
          promises in the iterable resolve, and rejects when <strong>all</strong> of the promises in the iterable fail.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          <code>Promise.race(promisesIterable)</code> settles with the eventual state off the first Promise that
          settles.
        </li>
        <li class="note">A promise is settled when it resolves or rejects, regardless of success.</li>
