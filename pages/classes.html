      <h1 class="main__heading">Classes & Object Oriented Programming</h1>
      <p class="main__description">
        Classes give us a way to define a new "template" of sorts for objects.
        <strong>Almost everything in JavaScript is an object</strong>, and almost all of those things are
        <strong>instances of built-in classes</strong>.
      </p>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Classes & Objects</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          Objects are just things that have properties that can be accessed. This means that Arrays are also objects,
          for example.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Understanding that an object can contain just about any other data type, including functions, is very
          important - when an object or class has a property that is also a function, it is also known as a
          <strong>method</strong>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          To define a new <code>class</code>, with starting parameters, we use the following syntax. The
          <code>constructor</code> method <strong>has to be named constructor</strong>, and nothing else - it's how we
          tell the code what to run when we <strong>instantiate</strong> a new object.
          <pre><code>class MyClass {
  constructor(param1, param2) {
    this.prop1 = param1;
    this.prop2 = param2;
  }

  addPropertyExampleMethod(paramKey, paramValue) {
    this.paramKey = paramValue;
  }
}</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          The <code>this</code> keyword will return the object at the root of the current scope. For classes, it allows
          us to represent an object that is instantiated based on the class we're creating.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          The simplest example of this is in the constructor above - we use <code>this.prop1 = param1</code> to say
          "hey, whenever an object is made with this class, give it a property/key called <code>prop1</code> with the
          value that's in <code>param1</code>".
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          To instantiate (create) a new object using a class as a template, we call its <code>constructor</code> method.
          To do this, we use the <code>new</code> keyword.
          <pre><code>const myObject = new MyClass("prop1 value", "prop2 value");
myObject.addPropertyExampleMethod("prop3", "prop3 value");</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          The above example will create a new object with three properties - prop1, prop2, and prop3 - with values
          "prop1 value", "prop2 value", and "prop3 value".
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Specifically, creating a class creates a new <strong>prototype</strong> for instantiated objects to reference.
          So if an object property doesn't exist, but does exist on its class/prototype, then when we try to access the
          property from the object, JS goes and finds the property on the parent, instead.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Classes can also contain data and properties that <strong>are not set when an object is instantiated</strong>,
          but instead, it exists in a constant state "publicly". An example of this would be the <code>Math</code> class
          - we don't need to create a new Math object to access its methods, like <code>Math.random()</code> or
          <code>Math.max()</code>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          We use the <code>static</code> keyword in front of a method or property to define a new static
          method/property.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          We can add new properties and methods to a prototype from anywhere using any object's <code>prototype</code>.
          Doing this to built-ins is generally not good practice, but knowing it's possible can help understand how
          prototypes work.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          For example, the following example would add a "sum" method to all arrays that returns the sum of all values
          in the array.
          <pre><code>Array.prototype.sum = function sum() {
  return this.reduce((acc, current) => acc + current, 0);
}
[1, 1].sum(); // 2</code></pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          Object-Oriented Programming is a way to capture similarities between different objects and give them a
          structure to draw from using <strong>Classes</strong> and <strong>Inheritance</strong>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          This allows us to structure code in a way that is easy to understand for humans, built on familiar concepts.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          <strong>Inheritance</strong> provides us a way to create classes based on other classes. For example, we could
          have a parent <code>class Person {}</code>, then two different children classes:
          <code>class Student extends Person {}</code> and <code>class Teacher extends Person {}</code>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          The <code>extends</code> keyword is how we create a new class that <strong>inherits</strong> all the
          properties and methods from a parent class. This encourages reusing common code for similar classes by giving
          each of them a common prototype to extend.
