                <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a language that came out in the mid-1990s, and by coincidence was the
                first programming language that was adopted for the web. It's a high-level, interpreted language -
                meaning that it is very distant from "the metal," and is interpreted into computer instructions via an
                <strong>interpreter</strong>.

                    JavaScript is one of the 3 core technologies that comprise any website or web application, along
                    with CSS and HTML.
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    Because it's the "language of the web," its staying power is beyond strictly its objective appeal or
                    supported features.

                <li class="note">
                    JavaScript can also be run on the server side, in the form of Node.js, which was built to allow
                    JavaScript to be a <strong>full-stack</strong> language.

                    An <strong>expression</strong> is kind of like a "sentence fragment" - it's smaller than a
                    statement, and is a small chunk of code that returns a specific value.
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    A <strong>statement</strong> is the smallest standalone piece of code that "says something" - it's
                    often (but not always) a single line of code, and in JavaScript, is separated from other statements
                    by a semicolon.
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    <strong>Syntax</strong> is comprised of the rules and symbols that allow a computer to "read" the
                    code you write - it's how you structure your statements and expression, and doesn't necessarily
                    always make 100% sense - it's just something about a language you'll need to memorize to make code
                    run.
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    A <strong>comment</strong> is text or content inside of a code file that isn't code, and isn't
                    interpreted or compiled by the machine. These are typically there for DX (developer experience) and
                    (hopefully) a client won't actually see them.

                <li class="note">
                    Immediately after the browser loads JavaScript, it will execute. This means that, all else being
                    equal, JavaScript will execute from top to bottom, and can't "see" code that's below it (with some
                    exceptions).
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    JavaScript is a <strong>loosely-typed</strong> language - as opposed to more strongly-typed
                    languages. The Number data type is a good example of this.

                <li class="note">
                    JavaScript has 5 <strong>immutable</strong>, <strong>primitive</strong> data types:

                    <li class="note">Number</li>

                <li class="note">
                    A <code>Number</code> is... a number. JavaScript (largely) doesn't distinguish between
                    floating-point and integer numbers - instead, all numeric operations are typically done with these
                    capital-N Numbers.
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    A <code>String</code> is a collection of ordered characters - basically, text data.
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    A <code>Boolean</code> is precisely either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> - a boolean can't
                    be anything other than these two.
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    A <code>null</code> value means, literally, null - there's nothing there, it's nothing. This is a
                    "known unknown" - we know, with certainty, that this value is exactly nothing. This is important to
                    understand because of the following type:
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    An <strong>undefined</strong> value also means there's nothing there, but it means that it's because
                    it literally doesn't exist. It would be exceedingly rare that you would ever see something "defined"
                    to be <code>undefined</code>, whereas <code>null</code> is a valid "value" for something.
