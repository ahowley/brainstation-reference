      <p class="main__description">
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a language that came out in the mid-1990s, and by coincidence was the first
        programming language that was adopted for the web. It's a high-level, interpreted language - meaning that it is
        very distant from "the metal," and is interpreted into computer instructions via an
        <strong>interpreter</strong>.
      </p>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">High-Level Info & Notes</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          JavaScript is one of the 3 core technologies that comprise any website or web application, along with CSS and
          HTML.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Because it's the "language of the web," its staying power is beyond strictly its objective appeal or supported
          features.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          JavaScript can also be run on the server side, in the form of Node.js, which was built to allow JavaScript to
          be a <strong>full-stack</strong> language.
        </li>
        <li class="note">VSCode is built in Node.js ðŸ’»</li>
        <li class="note">JavaScript files are denoted with the extension <code>*.js</code>.</li>
        <li class="note">
          To interact with the console in a browser, we refer to <code>console</code> - to log something to the console,
          for example, we can use <code>console.log(...values)</code>
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          JavaScript is generally agnostic to whitespace - it is <strong>not sensitive</strong> to whitespace in almost
          all situations, so we format our code according to style guides, convention, and preference.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Programming Terminology</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          An <strong>expression</strong> is kind of like a "sentence fragment" - it's smaller than a statement, and is a
          small chunk of code that returns a specific value.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          A <strong>statement</strong> is the smallest standalone piece of code that "says something" - it's often (but
          not always) a single line of code, and in JavaScript, is separated from other statements by a semicolon.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          <strong>Syntax</strong> is comprised of the rules and symbols that allow a computer to "read" the code you
          write - it's how you structure your statements and expression, and doesn't necessarily always make 100% sense
          - it's just something about a language you'll need to memorize to make code run.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          A <strong>comment</strong> is text or content inside of a code file that isn't code, and isn't interpreted or
          compiled by the machine. These are typically there for DX (developer experience) and (hopefully) a client
          won't actually see them.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Immediately after the browser loads JavaScript, it will execute. This means that, all else being equal,
          JavaScript will execute from top to bottom, and can't "see" code that's below it (with some exceptions).
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          JavaScript is a <strong>loosely-typed</strong> language - as opposed to more strongly-typed languages. The
          Number data type is a good example of this.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Primitive Data Types</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">JavaScript has 5 <strong>immutable</strong>, <strong>primitive</strong> data types:</li>
        <ul class="notes">
          <li class="note">Number</li>
          <li class="note">String</li>
          <li class="note">Boolean</li>
          <li class="note">Null</li>
          <li class="note">Undefined</li>
        </ul>
        <li class="note">
          A <code>Number</code> is... a number. JavaScript (largely) doesn't distinguish between floating-point and
          integer numbers - instead, all numeric operations are typically done with these capital-N Numbers.
        </li>
        <li class="note">A <code>String</code> is a collection of ordered characters - basically, text data.</li>
        <li class="note">
          A <code>Boolean</code> is precisely either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> - a boolean can't be
          anything other than these two.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          A <code>null</code> value means, literally, null - there's nothing there, it's nothing. This is a "known
          unknown" - we know, with certainty, that this value is exactly nothing. This is important to understand
          because of the following type:
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          An <strong>undefined</strong> value also means there's nothing there, but it means that it's because it
          literally doesn't exist. It would be exceedingly rare that you would ever see something "defined" to be
          <code>undefined</code>, whereas <code>null</code> is a valid "value" for something.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Operators</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          An <strong>Operator</strong> is a "thing that does a thing." This would include things like the arithmetic
          operators: <code>+ - * / % ^</code>
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          <code>+ - * / </code> work as you might expect them to, and do not require whitespace around them to function.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          <code>**</code> is the exponent operator, and raises a number to the power of another number.
          <code>5**2</code> would return 25.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          The <code>%</code> operator is known as the "modulo" operator, and it finds the remainer when dividing two
          numbers. For example, <code>9 % 5</code> would return 4, because 9 / 5 is 1, with a remainder of 4.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          We can represent parenthetical operations the exact same way we would in pen-and-paper mathematics - wrapping
          expressions in parenthesis. <code>(5 + 2) * 2</code> would return 7 * 2 = 14.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          The <strong>bang</strong> operator, sometimes called the "not" operator, is represented with an exclamation
          mark - <code>!</code>
        </li>
        <ul class="notes">
          <li class="note">
            The bang operator can go in front of anything, and will interpret what follows as a boolean - specifically,
            the opposite of the boolean interpretation of what follows.
          </li>
          <li class="note">
            If that's confusing - the simplest example would be that <code>!true</code> would return <code>false</code>.
          </li>
          <li class="note">
            You can chain bang operators - for example, <code>!!value</code> would convert anything inside of value to a
            simple boolean representation.
          </li>
          <li class="note">
            Most data types have some state in which they're considered "falsy" - meaning they are calculated as
            <code>false</code> in boolean operations.
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy" target="_blank"
              >You can reference falsy JS values on MDN here.</a
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li class="note">
          The <strong>and</strong> operator is represented with two consecutive ampersands - <code>&&</code>
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          The <strong>or</strong> operator is represented with two consecutive pipe characters - <code>||</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
