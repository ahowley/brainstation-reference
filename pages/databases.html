      <h1 class="main__heading">Databases</h1>
      <p class="main__description">
        Databases provide programs and computers a method of storing data at large scales, and reading or writing that
        data at high speeds in a modular, efficient way.
      </p>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          Data is stored as 1s and 0s, and the way we're used to interfacing with data is through files. Files are
          largely designed to be interactable and readable by humans, but databases are really only concerned with
          storing data in a machine-readable way.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          The most popular databases are either relational or non-relational, with MySQL being the most popular
          relational database, and MongoDB being the most popular non-relational database.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Databases are very "close to the metal," meaning they aren't spreadsheets or files in any traditional sense.
          Instead, data is often stored in "tables," which are collections of items and attributes that have some
          relationship.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Each table has rows and columns, with each row often representing a <strong>record</strong>. Columns would
          represent individual pieces of data about those records, and are often called <strong>fields</strong>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          A database can have multiple tables, with multiple types or categories of record. These can then be associated
          with one another in a variety of ways, which is where databases begin to really show their power.
        </li>
        <li class="note">In a database, everything has to have a unique ID. This is called a <strong>key</strong>.</li>
        <li class="note">
          Each table needs a field that holds a <strong>primary key</strong> - the unique identifier for that record. A
          <strong>foreign key</strong> would point to a relational record in a different database.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          There are a few types of <strong>relationships</strong> in a relational database:
          <strong>one-to-one (1:1)</strong> and <strong>one-to-many (1:N)</strong> are two of the most common.
          One-to-one would mean that each record relates to exactly one foreign record, while one-to-many would
          represent a single record that has a relationship with many of a different type of record.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          A <strong>many-to-many (M:N)</strong> relationship is also possible, where in both directions, records can
          have a relationship with many other records. Typically, when there is a many-to-many relationship, there is
          often a third table involved - sometimes called a "join" table - which will have an entry for each joined bit
          of data.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          <strong>SQL</strong> stands for <strong>Structured Query Language</strong> - it is a language that allows for
          <strong>queries</strong>, which pull data out of our tables quickly and efficiently.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          A <strong>Database Management System (DBMS)</strong> provides a method for manipulating and logging and
          interacting with data, like MySQL. A <strong>database (DB)</strong> isn't the thing we would normally work
          with - instead, we would work with a DBMS to handle database interactions.
