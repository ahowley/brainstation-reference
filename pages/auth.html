      <h1 class="main__heading">Authentication & Authorization</h1>
      <p class="main__description">
        User authentication and authorization allow us to control access to personal or private information and "scope"
        that information and data to individual visitors to our product or web app.
      </p>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Overview</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          <strong>Authentication</strong> is what allows a user to prove they are who they say they are.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          <strong>Authorization</strong> determines what an individual user is allowed to access on our site.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          There's single-factor, two-factor, or multi-factor authentication, each of which get progressively more
          secure.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Some types of security vulnerabilities we have to be aware of include
          <strong>man-in-the-middle</strong> attacks, which intercept sensitive data in transit,
          <strong>phishing</strong>, or fake pages that are meant to steal user credentials, and brute force or server
          attacks which directly target the security walls and try to get around them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">JSON Web Token (JWT)</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          A JWT (pronounced "jot") is a digitally signed and encoded bit of data that can be sent over http.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          A JWT consists of three parts: a <strong>header</strong>, a <strong>payload</strong>, and a
          <strong>signature</strong>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          The header will include the type of token and the signing algorithm, the payload contains "claims" about a
          user's identification, and the signature contains a hash of the header and payload with a secret key used to
          verify the token.
        </li>
        <li class="note">Each part of the token is separated by a period: "xxxxxx.yyyyyy.zzzzzz".</li>
        <li class="note">
          The header has two parts: <code>"alg"</code>, which is the signing algorithm, and <code>"typ"</code>, which is
          the type of token.
        </li>
        <li class="note">The payload is custom, but may (or may not) generally follow a common standard.</li>
        <li class="note">
          The payload has <code>"iss"</code>, the "issue" of the token, <code>"exp"</code>, which is the expiry,
          <code>"sub"</code>, which is the subject of the JWT, and custom data about the session or request as desired.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          We can store a JWT in sessionStorage or localStorage to allow a user to stay logged in and authenticated
          without needing continual authentication with every request a user makes.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          JWT tokens are used for "conversation" between client and server, but tokens shouldn't contain anything in
          them that could be changed (for example, some sort of identifier indicating level of privileges).
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          The standard for using the Authorization header to sign our requests looks something like:
          <pre><code>{
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer JWT_TOKEN_HERE"
  }
}</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          The order of events, broadly speaking, is 1) a token is created after the user is authenticated, 2) the token
          is sent to the browser, and 3) the browser sends this token back to the server along with all requests to
          prove the user's identity.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          It's important to note that JWTs are public, so sensitive data shouldn't be included. These are designed for
          authorization, not for sending sensitive data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Client-Side Auth</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          Servers will often provide a token to the client that the client can store to stay logged in. This will
          typically happen in the login request.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          The client-side will be responsible for persisting the authorization JWT token, and the server is responsible
          for generating and sending the token when a user logs in.
        </li>
        <li class="note">To log out, all we would need to do is delete a token on the client-side.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Server-Side Auth</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          HTTP requests are stateless - each request is fully independent, so we need a way to remember who a user is
          across requests.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          A <strong>session</strong> is a series of continuous actions on an application, and we can store temporary
          data about a given session to keep track of data related to that session without re-authenticating each time a
          user makes some request.
        </li>
        <li class="note">Session data is stored temporarily in memory, on the client and sometimes the server.</li>
        <li class="note">
          A shared cache allows multiple users to access frequently requested resources, and a connection pool allows
          their requests to be treated in a shared pool.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Server-side sessions are handled by handing a user a key in the form of a cookie. Data is stored on the server
          directly.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Multiple servers can create complexity when using cookies, and these won't work on devices that don't support
          cookies.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Client-side sessions are handled by receiving encoded data from the server as well, but the client sends
          tokens to the server to let it know we're still logged in.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          To handle JWT tokens for client-side sessions on the server, we can use the
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken" target="_blank">jsonwebtoken</a> library.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          We can generate a JWT with:
          <pre><code>jwt.sign({ payloadKey: payloadValue }, SECRET_KEY, { expiresIn: "24h" });</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          The third argument in the above example is the "options" parameter, which accepts many adjustable options. You
          can find what's available in options
          <a href="https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken" target="_blank">on the jsonwebtoken github</a>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          We can send these tokens to the client side, where the token can be stored and the user can continue to stay
          logged in.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          If a request requires a token, but a valid token wasn't provided, we can send back
          <code>401 Unauthorized</code>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          To validate a JWT hash on the server, we can use:
          <pre><code>jwt.verify(token, SECRET_KEY, (err, payload) => {});</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          We can also make custom middleware in express to verify a token that can be reused across multiple requests,
          that will either interept the request and send a rejection or continue onward and pass the payload as part of
          the request object.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Security Concerns</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          It is a good idea to encrypt passwords before storing them on the backend - one popular and easy-to-use
          library/hashing function for this is
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt" target="_blank">bcrypt</a>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          It's also a good idea to ensure that tokens expire regularly, and that when using token-based authentication,
          any sensitive actions in an account still continue to require re-authentication.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          There is a concept known as
          <strong>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)" target="_blank">salting</a>"</strong> a
          password, which is the process of adding random data fed as additional input to a one-way hashing function
          that encrypts the password.
