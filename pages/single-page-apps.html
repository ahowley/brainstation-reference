      <h1 class="main__heading">Single-Page Applications & React</h1>
      <p class="main__description">
        Many modern web apps have been moving to a single-page architecture, which is in contrast to having multiple
        static pages like a traditional website. This brings with it a number of new challenges, but the main benefits
        have to do with how similar these apps are to other modern apps, like mobile apps, and how nuanced we can get
        with user feedback and user interaction details.
      </p>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Client-Side Routers</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          In general, a <strong>router</strong> is the program or logic in charge of determining how to control the
          display of a certain web domain.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          There are many client-side routers available for use to create single-page applications, but even without one,
          it's possible to create a single-page, single-url application. In React, this would look like using State to
          control with main element to display at any given time.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          For example, we could create a <code>route</code> state variable and store the current selected page, then use
          it to determine which page to display based on the value of that state variable.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          <strong>Deep Linking</strong> is allowed by routers that look at the url, respond to changes to the endpoint,
          and change the state of the program accordingly. In a traditional app, this will just take you to a new page -
          in a single-page app, we need to use some kind of custom routing behavior to mimic forward and backward
          movement, and to detect which current page to display in general.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Both front-end and back-end software can use routers - a backend will determine which data to return to the
          client, while a front-end app will control state to alter the page that's displaying.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          In vanilla JavaScript, there is a
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API" target="_blank">History API</a> that
          lets us control how our app reports browser history, as well as allow us to interact with this history.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          There's nothing preventing us from interacting with this routing manually in React, or vanilla JavaScript, to
          manually create single-page behavior - but something like React Router will bundle this behavior "under the
          hood" and handle the side-effects smoothly for us.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">React Router</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          <a href="https://reactrouter.com/en/main" target="_blank">React Router</a> is a third-party package for
          mimicking client-side routing behavior. They use components to handle routing for us, rather than having to
          manually manage routing via state.
        </li>
        <li class="note">A "route" is a URL path that takes us to a specific resource/"page".</li>
        <li class="note">To install React Router, we can install it with <code>npm install react-router-dom</code>.</li>
        <li class="note">
          React Router has a few included components to help us handle routing. The top-level component is called
          <code>BrowserRouter</code>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          To make a new route, we put our routes inside of a <code>Route</code> component inside a
          <code>Routes</code> component inside a <code>BrowserRouter</code> component. Each route should have at least
          two props: a <code>path=</code> and an <code>element=</code>.
          <pre><code>return (
  &#60;BrowserRouter>
    &#60;Routes>
      &#60;Route path="/" element={&#60;Home />} />
      &#60;Route path="/about" element={&#60;About />} />
    &#60;/Routes>
  &#60;/BrowserRouter>
)</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          When using routing in a single-page app in React, it'd be common to have a "Pages" folder in addition to our
          usual "Components" folder.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          The <code>&#60;Link></code> component allows us to mimic the behavior of an anchor tag while staying on our
          own site.
          <pre><code>&#60;Link to="/">Home&#60;/Link></code></pre>
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          We can create a 404 page by using <code>&#60;Route path="*" element={&#60;NotFound />} /></code>
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          The <code>&#60;Navigate></code> component is similar to the Link component, but it allows us to redirect a
          user to a different route. There is also a hook for this called <code>useNavigate</code>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          We can set up relative paths using a colon in front of the name of the path that we want. State can help us
          here as well.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          To set up a relative path route:
          <pre><code>&#60;Route path="/path/:dynamic" element={&#60;Component />} /></code></pre>
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          To
          <a href="https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-params" target="_blank">actually handle a dynamic path</a>
          like the above, we'll need the <code>useParams</code> hook. This lets us grab whatever the optional path was
          sent in the URL and store.
          <pre><code>let params = useParams();</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Don't forget to <code>import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";</code> before trying to actually use
          params!
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          When defining the custom path, the colon <code>:</code> starts our parameter name. So we can access just one
          URL parameter from the object returned by <code>useParams()</code> in the normal JavaScript way:
          <pre><code>&#60;Route path="/path/:myDynamicString" element={&#60;MyComponent />} />
... // below would be inside MyComponent
const params = useParams();
console.log(params.myDynamicString);</code></pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </main>
