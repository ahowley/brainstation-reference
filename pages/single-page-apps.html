      <p class="main__description">
        Many modern web apps have been moving to a single-page architecture, which is in contrast to having multiple
        static pages like a traditional website. This brings with it a number of new challenges, but the main benefits
        have to do with how similar these apps are to other modern apps, like mobile apps, and how nuanced we can get
        with user feedback and user interaction details.
      </p>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Client-Side Routers</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          In general, a <strong>router</strong> is the program or logic in charge of determining how to control the
          display of a certain web domain.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          There are many client-side routers available for use to create single-page applications, but even without one,
          it's possible to create a single-page, single-url application. In React, this would look like using State to
          control with main element to display at any given time.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          For example, we could create a <code>route</code> state variable and store the current selected page, then use
          it to determine which page to display based on the value of that state variable.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          <strong>Deep Linking</strong> is allowed by routers that look at the url, respond to changes to the endpoint,
          and change the state of the program accordingly. In a traditional app, this will just take you to a new page -
          in a single-page app, we need to use some kind of custom routing behavior to mimic forward and backward
          movement, and to detect which current page to display in general.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Both front-end and back-end software can use routers - a backend will determine which data to return to the
          client, while a front-end app will control state to alter the page that's displaying.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          In vanilla JavaScript, there is a
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API" target="_blank">History API</a> that
          lets us control how our app reports browser history, as well as allow us to interact with this history.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          There's nothing preventing us from interacting with this routing manually in React, or vanilla JavaScript, to
          manually create single-page behavior - but something like React Router will bundle this behavior "under the
          hood" and handle the side-effects smoothly for us.
