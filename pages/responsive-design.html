                    Because there is no common, reliable screen size we can design for on the web, we have to design our
                    content to fit on the smallest screen first, then expand to display nicely on larger screens. This
                    is called <strong>Mobile First</strong> design.
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    It's easier to add complexity than to take it away, so it's often better to create focused designs
                    for different screen sizes.
                </li>
                <li class="note">The goal is to use all the available space on any given screen size effectively.</li>
                <li class="note">
                    A <strong>breakpoint</strong> is a defined viewport width or height where the styling of that site
                    should change to a new set of styling criteria.
                </li>
                <li class="note">To define specific breakpoints in CSS, we use <code>@media</code> queries.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="main__subheading">@media queries</h2>
            <ul class="notes">
                <li class="note">
                    Without using media queries and breakpoints, we're somewhat limited in our choices regarding
                    responsiveness. Using percentage values for widths, heights, and margins/padding can provide a good
                    baseline, along with good use of flex-box, but breakpoints give far more granular control.
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    Media queries are a CSS at-rule, and they allow us to conditionally apply part of a style sheet
                    based on the result of a "query" - essentially, we can ask @media for information about the device,
                    viewport, or condition in which our page is being viewed, and conditionally apply styles based on
                    the result.
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    <strong>Media types</strong> define the broad category of a device on which a media query applies.
                    By far the most common is <code>screen</code>, but other options are <code>all</code> (the default)
                    and <code>print</code>. Specifying the media type is done first: <code>@media screen</code>. If we
                    don't include a media type, it defaults to all, so this is not required and may not always be
                    necessary to include.
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    <strong>Media features</strong> desribe some specific characteristic of the
                    <strong>user agent</strong> (basically, the viewer of the page), and are where we "query" specific
                    properties of the device/person/etc. that's interacting with the page. Common examples would include
                    <code>min-width</code>, <code>max-height</code>, or <code>hover</code>.
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    You can find an exhaustive list of media types & features

                <li class="note">
                    The commonly used viewport meta tag in most html boilerplate
                    <code>&#60;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&#62;</code>
                    "initializes" a web page to align the width of the page with the device-width of the
                    user-agent/viewer.
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    We can use <strong>logical operators</strong> to create multiple conditions for a media query,
                    including <code>not</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>only</code>, and <code>or</code>.
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    An example of a complete media query would look something like this:
                    <code
                        >@media screen and ((min-width: 425px) and (max-width: 767px)) { /* only applies between 425px
                        and 767px, inclusive */ }</code
                    >.
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    Media queries <strong>do not interact with specificity or the cascade</strong> - they only "expose"
                    code provided the conditions are met. If your media queries override properties, they should come
                    later in a stylesheet than what they're overwriting, or else they will fail.
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    We can use <code>@content</code> with Sass to define a wrapper mixin, allowing us to use a mixin as
                    a wrapper. For example,
                    <code>@mixin tablet { @media (min-width: 426px) and (max-width: 767px) { @content } }</code> could
                    be used to create a media query surrounding a css block like this:
                    <code>@include tablet { .hidden-tablet { display: none;} }</code>
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    Media queries are a vital tool in responsive design. We can use the "min-width" and "max-width"
                    definitions to define the aforementioned breakpoints, possibly even in a @mixin in Sass, and
                    leverage that to create a stylesheet that is fully responsive to a viewport's size.

                <li class="note">
                    Most images online have historically been <strong>raster images</strong>, which define an image in
                    terms of exactly which pixels should be displayed in which location.
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    A <strong>vector image</strong>, by contrast, is instead defined by formulas, shapes, and curves,
                    which then need to be rendered by a program (in this context, a browser), which makes them
                    lightweight and infinitely scaleable.
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    Vector images are preferable when they're usable, due to their small size and infinite scalability,
                    but they definitely have limitations regarding the amount of detail they can render compared to
                    "traditional" raster images.
                </li>
                <li class="note">
                    Example raster formats include <code>.webp</code>, <code>.png</code>, <code>.jpg</code>, and
                    <code>.gif</code>.
                </li>
                <li class="note">The primary example of a vector image format is <code>.svg</code>.</li>
