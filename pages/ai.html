        Artificial Intelligence has changed the landscape of technology and software in the last couple of years - these
        notes cover a little bit about the history of AI, as well as some basic concepts about what AI is and how it is
        used by contemporary software engineers.
      </p>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          ChatGPT is probably the biggest "name" in the AI world right now, but there are other powerful chatbots being
          developed, like Google's Bard.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Up until the 21st century, there were doubts about the practical and financial applications of AI, so research
          tended to be a bit slower.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Apple acquired Siri in the 2000s, which was one of the first big breakthroughs in mainstream AI's adaptation.
          Alexa and Google Assistant soon followed.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          AI has been adopted recently at an extremely accelerated pace, compared to conventional tech adoption.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          As data volumes online grew and grew in the past decade, it became much more frictionless to actually train
          generalized (or pseudo-generalized) AI tools.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          As our hardware has gotten more powerful consistently over time, computers are simply capable of more, faster.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          The term "Artificial Intelligence" has become a kind of short-hand for computer algorithms that are capable of
          iterating or "learning" by themselves in order to perform tasks or display "cognitive" abilities typically
          associated with people.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          AI is the name for the whole field, while <strong>Machine Learning</strong> is a subset where algorithms learn
          from large sets of data. <strong>Deep Learning</strong> is the field in which algorithms attempt to mimic the
          behavior of "neural networks" conceptually similar to how a biological brain might think.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Chatbots can be a useful shortcut for a lot of things, like roleplaying an interview, quizzing you on certain
          subjects, asking ChatGPT to summarize certain large blocks of information, etc.
