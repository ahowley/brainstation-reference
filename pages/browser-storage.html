      <h1 class="main__heading">Storing Data Locally in the Browser</h1>
      <p class="main__description">
        There are several different ways to save data in a client's browser - localStorage, caching, cookies, etc. The
        Web Storage API is one of the simplest available APIs for persisting data, or keeping data that stays between
        sessions, and the sessionStorage API is for handling data that persists throughout one particular session. There
        are a few other available methods for storing data client-side - other things to look into include the

          Local storage in browsers allow us to "remember" something about a user's behavior between sessions, even if
          they aren't logged in. Using the

            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage" target="_blank"
              >localStorage</a
            >
            property</strong
          >
          is a great way to do this, because we don't have to actually store any of the user's data on the server to
          allow that data to persist.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Just like regular JavaScript objects, localStorage stores data in key-value pairs - specifically, key-value
          pairs that <strong>have to be strings</strong>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          To facilitate storing data in a string format, we can use <code>JSON.stringify()</code> to convert all our
          keys and values into a string. Another word for this is <strong>serializing</strong> our data.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Some good examples of uses for localStorage would include a dark mode/dark theme, language settings, or a
          shopping cart.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Anyone with physical access to the computer where data is saved can see localStorage - which means sensitive
          data should never be stored in localStorage.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Each domain has separate localStorage, which is not shared between domains at all. This means a website can
          only read or write data associated with their paraticular domain.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          In order to store something to localStorage, we can simply use the
          <code>localStorage.setItem(stringKey, JSON.stringify(someObject));</code> method.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          We can then get that item back using <code>localStorage.getItem(JSON.parse(stringKey));</code>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          To remove something from localStorage, we can use <code>localStorage.removeItem(stringKey);</code>, and to
          clear everything, we can use <code>localStorage.clear()</code>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          To view localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB, and cookies, as well as shared and cached storage, we can
          look at the Application tab in our browser's dev tools. We can also alter or clear localStorage from here for
          testing.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          In React, we can think of fetching data from localStorage similarly to how we fetch data using axios - meaning
          we will often need to use the <code>useEffect</code> hook to access localStorage whenever the page loads.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage" target="_blank"
            ><strong>sessionStorage</strong></a
          >
          is very similar to localStorage, but it will only persist data until a session is ended. Each individual new
          browser tab that goes to a domain gets its own sessionStorage property, and sessionStorage is cleared whenever
          a browser tab or window is closed. This makes it similar to memory, with the advantage that memory isn't
          needed. This storage is scoped to individual tabs, but will be duplicated if a tab is duplicated.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          sessionStorage is helpful for when users are working on an in-progress document or form that we want to ensure
          won't get cleared on a refresh of some kind. We also shouldn't store anything sensitive, though. This is also
          another perk of ensuring your components are controlled - behavior like this can all be managed with state in
          React or reactive applications.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Note that while sessionStorage is "scoped" to individual tabs, localStorage is "scoped" to the entire domain
          globally.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          It's also worth mentioning that clearing browser data will clear out localStorage, so it shouldn't be used for
          anything that's critical to the functionality of your website.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="main__subheading">Cookies</h2>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li class="note">
          A cookie is a type of data sent on an HTTP request of some kind, and is stored both locally and on the server.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Similar to localStorage, a cookie stores data in a key-value pair, but they can also be given an expiry date
          to make them automatically clear themselves after a given amount of time.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Cookies are also "scoped" to a specific domain, thanks to the
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy" target="_blank"
            >Same Origin Policy</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          A cookie can be locked down to be disallowed from scripted modification, and all cookies can
          <strong>only be altered by requests made over HTTPS</strong>.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          <a href="https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie" target="_blank">js-cookie</a> is an easy-to-use, lightweight
          API for interfacing with browser cookies.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          To set a cookie with js-cookie, we can use a similar-looking interface to localStorage:
          <code>Cookies.set(stringKey, stringValue, {expiry: 1});</code>. To retrieve:
          <code>Cookies.get("stringKey");</code>. The expiry in this example is set in number of days.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Cookies are typically used for keeping track of user activity and analytics, or for keeping track of user
          authentication/identification.
        </li>
        <li class="note">
          Cookies can be manipulated by third-party scripts, while localStorage and sessionStorage are generally more
          secure, but all of them should be used with caution.
