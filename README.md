# BrainStation Software Engineering Quick Reference

This is a simple site with some small notes and demos I built while attending [BrainStation](https://brainstation.io/)'s
Software Engineering bootcamp. [It's hosted on Github Pages](https://ahowley.github.io/brainstation-reference/) for
future reference by myself and fellow BrainStation students.
