# BrainStation Software Engineering Quick Reference

This is a simple site with some small notes and demos I built while attending BrainStation's Software Engineering
bootcamp. [It's hosted on Github Pages](https://ahowley.github.io/brainstation-reference/) for future reference by
myself and fellow BrainStation students.
